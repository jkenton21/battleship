# battleship

The purpose of this project is to create a battleship game.

The user will play against the computer and will place their ships on a grid.
Then the user and computer will take turns guessing the location of each others ships.
If the correct grid is hit where a ship is, it will record a hit.
If every part of the ship is hit, the ship will record as sunken.
Whoever sinks all enemy ships first wins.
